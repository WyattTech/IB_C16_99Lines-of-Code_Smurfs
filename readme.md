Info

This lab consists of two parts
*In this iteration you will be doing most of the logic/coding
*You will also get started on the graphical appearance
    ** The code will display the results in the developer console
    ** The HTML is just a test placeholder for part 2 of this lab

*Objectives:
+++
A) Create an array called friends. It will hold five of your friends' names.
B) For every friend in the friend array, you will want to console.log the descending chorus of this brand-new, never before seen song 100 times. The lyric must include your friend's name, and must be grammatically correct when we get down to 1. See the example output for more information.
C) In the HTML, set the page title to 99 Lines of Code In The File
D) Put an h1 element in the html body that says My Singing Friends
E) Put a div element in the html body with a class of friend.
F) Inside the div element, put an h3 element that contains the word "Friend"
G) Inside the div element, put 5 p elements.
H) Inside the p elements, put "Test1", "Test2", ..., "Test5"
I) Style the page
J) Set a background color on the page.
K) Change the text color of the h1.
L) Set a background color for class friend.
M) Target the h3 element inside the friend class div and make it uppercase using only CSS.
N) You have stylistic freedom to make the page look good

O) Hints: 
*You will need to use two loops to accomplish this task
    ** One loop is nested inside the other
    ** The outer loop is picking the friend. For each friend, the inner loop runs for every line of the song.

Submission
